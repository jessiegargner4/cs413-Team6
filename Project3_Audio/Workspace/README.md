##	Game	Title: Turkey Run (I couldnt remember what Georgia wanted to call it so you can change this.)

##	Instructions
You are the fatest turkey in the land and are coveted by every hunter for their Thanksgiving dinner.
Fortunately, you are as smart as you are plump. Use the space bar to jump up onto the platforms in 
the trees to escape. Be careful! You will be able to hear the hunters getting closer and closer.
Once they get clsoe enough, they will start to shoot bullets at you. Get to the flag at the top
of the tree without getting hit by a bullet or you will become dinner!

##	Known	Bugs	or	Issues
Currently we have a known bug in our bulelt mechanincs. They were originally working where they
would start shooting at a given time interval with a random spread and would shoot in the direction
of the turkey, but now for some reason they seem to get stuck on something and jsut stack up on top 
of each other. =(
