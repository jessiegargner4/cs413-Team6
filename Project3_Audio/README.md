The main player (you) plays as the turkey and your goal is to reach to the top by jumping and landing on colored blocks.
If you step off of a colored block onto a regular one, the music will stop and you will have to try again.
In order to win you need to reach the top while staying on the colored blocks in order to keep the music playing.
